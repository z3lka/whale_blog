Since I was a little child, unaware of what's going on outside of my little world, I've watched a lot of movies, read decent number of books.

From those, I tried to add something to myself.

Here's some of them:

- Spirit (2002) â€” It effected me deeply, I can see reflections of it on my behaviours/decisions today. Freedom is not easy to obtain.
- Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson â€” Think different, Jobs is a one of a kind person, irreplaceable
- Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance â€” ðŸ¤”
- Randy Paush the last lecture
- The Wind Rises â€”
